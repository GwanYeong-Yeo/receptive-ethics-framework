# Receptive Ethics Framework  
Affective Ethical Judgment System  
by **Yeo Gwan-Yeong**, 2025

---

## 🧠 Overview

This project implements a cognitive-emotional ethical judgment framework based on the philosophical structure:

**감응 → 유예 → 조율 → 리듬화 → 판단**  
(SENSE → SUSPEND → CALIBRATE → RHYTHMIZE → JUDGE)

It simulates how emotional input is processed through internal ethical rhythms and self-adjustment before making a judgment.

## ⚙️ System Features

- Emotional input (stimulus) is sensed and evaluated
- High-intensity input is automatically suspended for ethical pause
- Calibrated internal processing simulates moral reasoning
- Recent decisions influence future ones rhythmically (repetitive ethics)
- Fully implemented in Python with simulation-ready code
